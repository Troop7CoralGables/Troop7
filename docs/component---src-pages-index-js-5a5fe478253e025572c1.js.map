Today, only the chimney remains. After the hurricane \n      of 1926, Merrick's Coral Gables Construction Company built the Troop 7 scout cabin largely from pine trees and telephone poles.\n      Merrick deeded these two acres of land, now in the middle of the Granada Golf Course, to the scouts in perpetuity. Their first \n      scoutmaster was Albert H. Bartle. As scoutmaster for the first three years, then a committee member, Mr. Bartle served Troop 7 for \n      16 years until 1938, setting the standard for excellence and longevity for others to follow. The old Troop 7 log cabin burned down \n      on March 30, 1971, leaving only the chimney. The new building, finished in 1976, was dedicated to Scoutmaster Rex Hawkins, who \n      kept the troop alive during the difficult WWII years when many adult leaders were away. The George Merrick Foundation continues \n      to maintain the property, with help from the City of Coral Gables, the Kiwanis Club of Coral Gables and concerned citizens who appreciate \n      the legacy of George Merrick scouting program.\n    </p>\n    <p>\n      Since 1922, more than three thousand boys have benefited from the timeless lessons that only scouting can offer, \n      and a number of our adult volunteers have accomplished more than 30 years of service with the troop. The troop is \n      sponsored by the Kiwanis Club of Coral Gables. Our scout cabin, originally constructed in 1926, is located at \n      1107 South Greenway on the Granada Golf Course in Coral Gables, Florida.\n    </p>\n\n  </Layout>\n)\n\nexport default IndexPage\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
